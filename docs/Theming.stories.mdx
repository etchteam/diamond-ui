# Theming

Diamond UI supports component theming, but does not provide any production ready themes out of the box.

All themes are based around a core set of variables.

<Source code={theme} language='css' />

These can be overridden by setting the `:root` CSS variables to create a base theme, as well as creating theme classes which can wrap components or groups of components.

This setup allows consuming apps to create an infinite number of themes to apply to components, as well as allowing those themes to be applied at different levels within a page or app, rather than requiring them to be global.

## Examples

Diamond UI optionally includes an example set of 3 basic themes: light, medium and dark. The theme tokens are set on the `:root` and then applied to the base theme via classes, such as `.diamond-theme-dark`.

Components that support theming will apply the base theme tokens, such as setting background to `--diamond-theme-background`.

<Source code={themes} language='css' />

### Cards using demo themes

Here is an example of 3 cards wrapped in the demo theme classes, which then apply the theme tokens.

<Canvas>
  <diamond-grid wrap="wrap">
    <diamond-grid-item small-mobile="12" tablet="4">
      <diamond-card class="diamond-theme-light">
        <h3>Card title</h3>
        <p>
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
          tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
        </p>
      </diamond-card>
    </diamond-grid-item>
    <diamond-grid-item small-mobile="12" tablet="4">
      <diamond-card class="diamond-theme-medium">
        <h3>Card title</h3>
        <p>
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
          tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
        </p>
      </diamond-card>
    </diamond-grid-item>
    <diamond-grid-item small-mobile="12" tablet="4">
      <diamond-card class="diamond-theme-dark">
        <h3>Card title</h3>
        <p>
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
          tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
        </p>
      </diamond-card>
    </diamond-grid-item>
  </diamond-grid>
</Canvas>

## Recommended themes

In most projects we recommend a base set of themes for light, medium and dark.

We would also recommend creating some state based themes for states such as info, success, warning and error.
