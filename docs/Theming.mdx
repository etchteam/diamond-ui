# Theming

Diamond UI supports component theming but provides no production-ready themes out of the box.

All themes are based on a core set of variables.

<docs-token-table code={theme}></docs-token-table>

These can be overridden by setting the `:root` CSS variables to create a base theme and creating theme classes that can wrap components or groups of components.

This setup allows consuming apps to create an infinite number of themes to apply to components and apply those themes at different levels within a page or app, rather than requiring them to be global.

## Examples

Diamond UI optionally includes an example set of 3 basic themes: light, medium and dark. The theme tokens are set on the `:root` and then applied to the base theme via classes, such as `.diamond-theme-dark`.

Components that support theming will apply the base theme tokens, such as setting the background to `--diamond-theme-background`.

<docs-token-table code={themes}></docs-token-table>

### Cards using demo themes

Here is an example of 3 cards wrapped in the demo theme classes, which then apply the theme tokens.

<Canvas of={ThemingStories.Theming} />

## Recommended themes

In most projects, we recommend a base set of themes for light, medium and dark.

We would also recommend creating some state based themes for states such as info, success, warning and error.
