## Interactive elements
Interactive custom elements can be wrapped in an `a` or a `button` or a `label`. These elements must be added to the css selector in `base/interactive.css` to make the semantic element invisible. You can also use `data-interactive` as a catch all child element, if for some reason the element you need is not covered.
